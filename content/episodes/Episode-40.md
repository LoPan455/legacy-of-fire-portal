The party ignored any requests to clean up corpses and headed out to try to get an audience with the captain of the sunset ship. Upon reaching the gangplank, Akbar and Valin met with one unconvinced but friendly large man named Zabu, and an even less convinced and irriatbel man named Luthar, They were guarding the ship and basically told them all to f right off. After much pleading and threats from both sides Zabu agreed to meet them at Jerikals ales later in the day.

At Jerikals the party got some drink and some lunch and waited. Eventually Zabu came in and made some banter with Jerikal as if they knew eachother. He then slammed a pesh beer and headed upstairs with a few ladies of the night. He made motion to the party that they should follow. They each in turn bought their own women and headed up or snuck up the stairs after Sallah started a distraction with a lively dace.

Upstairs, Zabu explained that the captain didn't seem all to excited to see them, but had agreed to have "The Professor" meet you all back at Rayhem's villa. With that, he went off to be with his women, and the women the party paid for. The party headed back to Rayhems.

The professor showed up, a very long winded and knowledgable man with a cool hat and a whip. He explained that the captain was here on a mission to collect dangerous items and remove them from the world. Her relationship with the Jackel provides many suck items and although she isn't happy with the means she is quite happy with the results. However, Rayhem is a friend of the professors, so they have decided to help. He explains about some underwater caves to get in, and that the jackel should be deistracted due to his meeting with the captain this afternoon. He provides the party with directions and a life bubble wand, and cloak of the manta ray, and a few other useful items. During this time, Akbar sends a sending to Heleen, which he believes is the captian of the sunset ship. The response isn't quite as warm as he expected. The professor teleports away and the party preps for water combat and rents a boat.

Close to where they believe the cave is, but out of sight on their boat, the party jumps into the sea. After a few minutes of swimming them spot some aquatic fish men hauling a box toward the shore and they follow. They lead them to an underwater cave where they fight the fish men they were following plus a few more. After hopping out of the water, the party buffs up and heads off down one of the 2 cave entrances.

They stroll through a dark dinning hall and into what appears to be some sort of shrine. There is a pile of bodies and body parts in front of an obvious shrine to rovagug. The smell is horrible. Suddenly, the pile moves and a few ghouls shamble out and attack. The party puts them down quickly and moves on through a locked door in the back of the room.

They come to a large underwater lake with a bridge across it. There are large double doors across the bridge. Someone spots something in the water and a strange aquatic beholder like thing attacks them. It manages to stun a few people with it's eye ray, but it is pump't full of arrow and magic before it can blink again. The party crosses the bridge and heads toward the double door.
