Akbar and Sallah finally wander into this existence… they look confused about what the hell is going on, but they quickly assess who the enemy is. Akbar starts slinging spells and Sallah starts to make his way across the room to join up with Valin.

The details of the fight become fuzzy, as reality warped around them. In the end, all the guards lay dead and Baleena’s pit had managed to catch some of her allies. Boomer used his fart ring to jump down and get them as the party brought the fight into the adjacent reality room chasing after the main bitch.

They find her in there hovering over a pool of the chaos goop talking to yet another creator. This one appears to have a far off glazed over look to his eyes and doesn’t seem to recognize the first bitch as she whispers in his ear. He springs to action as well and begins to sling spells. Valin resists one as he rushes in, flying over the pool of chaos on his trusty cum dumpster, and hammers on the main bitch. Still comes in behind him and leaps across the pool onto the cum dumpster rushing forward to aid in the fight. The main bitch is quickly dropped… and all seems to be coming to a quick end here…. But the crazy guy in the pool is still flinging spells wildly about the room. Still gets hit, and finally the chaos magic takes hold. Where Still once stood, there is now a fancy teal spoon lying on the surface of the cum dumpster.

The rest of the party rushes forward and makes quick work of this last crazy guy. As he dies, reality all around them starts to erode. The party makes a quick scan of the room, finds a stash of treasure held in a fancy coffer, and then has Boomer and Baleena teleport them away as this reality dissolves.

End.
