The party wandered around town and did a bunch of shopping. They asked around about the one source merchant guild, both through contacts Still could find in the thieves guild and through the dervish. They found out the following...

The one source merchant guild is a legitimate merchant guild in good standing with the pact masters, but it is well know that they trade heavily in slaves and that maybe all of the items they have acquired and sold may not have been acquired by completely legal means.

Maysan Fajair is the face of the organization, she is said to be a half elf and the most beautiful woman in the city. She is also Barley's former (I guess legally still) owner.

Father Jackel is the muscle of the org. Some say he is a werejackel, some say he is a massive gnoll, some say he is actually a intelligent jackel. All can agree that he gets what he wants and very few if any who have crossed paths with him have ever been seen again.

They own a large warehouse and dock near the south end of the docks that are on the east side of the city.

It is said they do a lot of trade with the Sunset Ship.

The sunset ship comes every 7 years on the same day of the year... which happens to be coming up in a few days. It has been doing this for as long as anyone can remember.

The sunset ship comes to port and pays top dollar for the most evil items the city has to offer. Thus the heavy trade with the one source merchant guild.

It is rumored that the sunset ship always pays for its items in red rubies of a distinct size and shape.

Later in the evening the party went back to Rayhims to have dinner with him. The pact master merchant, a young priestess, and a middle aged woman with a crazy nose ring attached to ear ring with a chain also came. They found out that the priestess was an acolyte of Adbar, and the nose ring woman is a high powered dealer in magic items.

The priestess was kind, polite and proper.

The nose ring lady did coke with boomer in the bathroom.

During the dinner there wasa knock on the door, some in the party went to overhear Rayhem's heated conversation with a stout, tough looking Halfling at the door. He was from the one sourced merchant guild and was claiming that Rayhem was in possession of something that belongs to the guild. Rayhem told the man he was mistaken and sent him on his way, he may gave some vague threat as he left.

Dinner concluded. The guests went home, a discussion was had with Rayhem about the scroll... but we kind of skipped over this and will have to come back to it.

Damascious and Valin did some flirting and flexing to try to get on Baleena's good side (she is the young apprentice who you rescued from troglodytes at lvl 1).

Everyone went to sleep.

If the middle of the night, some were woken up by the sound of a door being kicked in and the sound of many people moving about the building.

End.
