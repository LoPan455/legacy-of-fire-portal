# Episode 54: The Raising of Akbar and the Scroll of Kakishone #

This recrap is being written like a whole year after the events of this session went down. Everything is very fuzzy but some events are being recorded for posterity.

The party arrives back at Rayhim’s villa along with the Drow Master Matajinn and the Marid Princess Shazathared. They explain to Rayhim what is going on. He is excited that the eye has been found and he is ready to open the door to Kakishone whenever the party is.

The party runs out to get Akbar and Damacious resurrected. Akbar comes back, but the spirit of Damacious refuses to return.

After being filled in on what went down in the tower and being shown that all but boomer are now marked by the Grand Vizer of the efreet, and pledged to his service, Akbar loses his shit. He is about ready to walk off, but somehow pulls it together…. I think mainly due to the fact that they still have Nefeshti to save although my memory on this whole speech is fuzzy. I also don’t recall if Akbar confronted or interacted with Matajinn at all. I don’t think he did as Matajinn would have been invisible.

Shazathared thanks the party again for her freedom and ensures them that their story will live for eternity, and then she planeshifts away.

They go to the hall of the Dervish to find that Shazathared has already added a story to the annals recalling the bravery and heroics of Sallah and the templars of the 7 winds. There is much drinking and dancing.

In the morning, a little funeral for Damacious is held and the party then prepares to leave, making sure to leave all their bags of holding and extra dimensional spaces secured in Rayhim’s villa to avoid any dimensional mishaps.

Rayhim starts the ritual, assisted by his student Baleena. Once the part of the ritual that uses the impossible eye is completed, Matajinn takes the eye and departs. As the ritual continues, a swirling portal begins to open over the scroll of kakishone that you can now see is actually a map. Suddenly, the swirling seems to explode outward. Rayhim starts shouting that something is wrong and he has lost control. Everyone gets sucked into the portal and find themselves in a vortex (including Rayhim and Baleena).

Rayhim’s villa quickly fades out of sight behind you, and ahead you see the map of Kakishone rapidly expanding in front of you. Suddenly, the entire vortex erupts in fire and you hear a dull roar. The roar grows louder, and you realize it is hundreds of voices screaming out in victory. Suddenly, creatures start whipping past you at rapid speed, weapons drawn as if ready for battle. They appear to be mostly effreet and gnolls, but all look unworldly. You quickly guess that they have all been augmented by powerful wishcraft. You attempt to reach out for them, to slash a them or shoot them but your limbs and weapons pass harmlessly through their bodies as they fly past. After the stream of soldiers comes a large and menacing looking efreet. You immediately recognize it as Javhuul himself. He pauses briefly enough to smile at you mockingly. He lets out a guttural booming laugh as he continues to fly past you.  

The map continues to grow in front of you, it appears to be focusing in on the 3 islands that form a ring around a protected bay in the north west corner of the map.

Suddenly, Barley’s lamp explodes and lightning flashes everywhere. As you blink your eyes Nefeshti herself now floats beside you. You try to speak, but you find your voice does not travel in the vortex. Nefeshti looks sorrowful but determined. She snaps her fingers once and all of the templar weapons disappear from your possession. With a final sigh she takes off after Javhuul.

After that, the vortex fades around you. For a brief instance everything is dark. You open your eyes and find yourself lying on a beautiful sandy beach. It is the perfect temperature and you feel the warmth of the sun on your face… but see no sun in the sky. On the edge of the beach, a tropical forest stretches as far as the eye can see in both directions. Looking out toward the water you see that is a crimson red color and appears calm and inviting. Across the protected lagoon, you see 2 other islands. One of them rising quickly to rocky bluff above the jungle.

End.
