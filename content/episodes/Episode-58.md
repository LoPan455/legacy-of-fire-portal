The party spends some time to rest and recoup at the beach gazebo, partaking of many drinks and powders. During this time, someone decides to drink from the non-musical horn from the beast and finds that drinking from the horn imbues magical properties of either enchantment breaking or protection via skin of gold… there are 5 uses left until it is out.

The party decides it is time to go. Someone blows the horn and an iron ship appears on the horizon, sailing directly toward the port even thought here is no wind. As it approaches you hear music drifting over the wine, bawdy pirate jigs are being sung by loudly slurred voices.  

As the boat docks the party are welcomed aboard by the crew or ruffians which include first mate Sweatie Mae (a large, tough looking human woman), a terrifying looking tattooed master of arms they call Charly Rive “or just The Knives” (possibly half orc or real ugly fat human), the ship chandler who goes by The Duke (a dandy of a man, well dressed in only the finest), and the bard Old Tom (an old, withered human male who looks to have spent 100 lifetimes in the sun and on the sea).  

Old Tom introduces the captain as he comes out on deck. A one armed dwarf who fills every generic pirate captain cliché you can think of. He goes by the name of Capt. Grintsby Riddle and welcomes you aboard his ship, the *Luciferno*.

Introductions aside, the Capt. assumes you have killed the beast and he is here to carry you off to Singer Port to drink, whore, gamble, and regale all who will listen of your tale of dashing do. Cheers go out from the crew and Tom is just about to break into song when you poop all over their party and start talking about this conc shell that a turtle gave you and mention that you want to meet the creators. Some of the crew look confused. Charlie Rive and Old Tom look a bit serious and maybe saddened. 

Capt. Riddle explains that he can take you to the island of Not, off the edge of the world, if that is your wish but questions why the hell you would want to go there if the whole of Kakishone is open to you. After some discussion he explains that if you sail off the edge of the world he can’t bring you back, and in fact most of the crew won’t be coming back either. He and the *Luciferno* will be fine, the will reappear again when needed, but you will not be able to call them back to Not once you are there.

Questions are asked about where you are, where the island of Not is, and where the pleasure palace of Nex are at. Someone asks who has the map tatoo… and sure enough Charly Rive pulls up his shirt to reveal a map of Kakishone on his back. They point out a few landmarks and explain that Not would lie in Charlie’s taint, and no one wants to go there.

There is much discussion and deliberation, and some convincing from Balena that they have to go see if Rayheem is ok, eventually you agree that you sail for Singer Port. There is much rejoicing and the Duke orders the crew to pull up a barrel of the best rum. Old Tom breaks into song and the Capt orders the crew to heave away.

Old Tom’s song copied below.

The party barge to Singer Port has been on the water a few hours when a small island is spotted off the port side by a few of the crew. Capt. Riddle immediately calls everyone with ranged weapons to battle stations and to man the ballistae. He tells everyone else to grab masts and hang on. Confused, the party asks what the hell is happening, as Drex and Still head to ballistae to help out. The Captain explains that there is no island out here, which means that was The Glutton of Gallies, The Turtle King, Kirhosk!

Just then the shell appears about 100 ft off the port side. The Capt turns the ship sharply and tells everyone to open fire. Most projectiles bounce off the shell but Drex hits home with a ballista and Akbar  and Balena get to the gunwall and slings some spells. The turtle does not slow, and it rams the boat. Akbar and a few other crew members are flung overboard. The crew scrambles to get everyone back in the boat, but Akbar is not the best swimmer and he begins to sink. Still and Valin are quick to jump after him, as Balena takes Still’s spot at the ballista. 

The turtle, seeing prey in the water, grabs Akbar in his massive jaw. Valin and Still start going to work, cutting deep in the turtle as the swim around his head. Drex and Balena continue to fire ballista shots and the Capt maneuvers the ship and drops anchor hoping to give Akbar a way to climb back aboard. The turtle begins to crush Akbar and releases a steamy breath of hot pain over everyone. The ship gets close enough that Boomer, in a drunken stupor, starts channeling hoping to hit those under water. He keeps Akbar alive as Valin and Still continue to gut this thing. It doesn’t last long under their assault and soon Valin and Still come climbing out of the now redder wine with Akbar in tow, as the turtle floats lifeless by the boat.  There was much rejoicing. 

The Capt. Mentions that he thinks he knows where the turtle's lair might be, at the bottom of the great whirlpool deep in the sea of Pino. The party tables that thought for now, but vows to revisit it.

Upon arrival in Singer Port, the crew departs the *Luciferno* and heads out to various dens of ill repute. You have never seen a more joyous hive of scum and villainy. Everyone looks like pirates of the worst kind, and all of them seem to be having the time of their lives. You go with Sweetie, Charlie, and Old Tom to a drinking hall called The Soggy Boot. Inside, everyone is singing and drinking heavily, and everyone is very happy to see the crew, especially Tom. 

Sweetie explains that if you want to drink your sorrows or celebrate your wins, this is the place to be. But if you’re looking for a rowdy fight it won’t be tolerated here. You gotta take that shit to Old Jack’s down the street and settle your scores in Jack’s Pulpit (a fighting arena) so that everyone can bet right proper on the match. Valin asks about prize money, and Sweetie confirms there is loot to be won. By this time Old Tom has broken into his same song about Singer Port and everyone is singing along. Mugs of beer that have faces on them and little arms and legs are dancing down the bar and you are encouraged to grab one and drink up. Valin sings along, and as they get to the part about in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king, Tom actually hands Valin a ring and gives him a wink. Akbar activates true seeing and realizes all the people in the bar, save for Old Tom, are actually doppelgangers. 

Soon, Valin realizes that looking through the ring it operates as a Gem of True Seeing and he sees all the doppelgangers as well. It’s a bit unnerving and it kills the buzz so they gather the party and head off for the Pleasure Palace of Nex, which is a few hours walk up the hills toward the mountains. Belena was itching to get here anyway as she thinks they will find Rayheem there.

The party eventually arrives and is welcome into the pleasure palace… but it isn’t really a palace anymore so much as a pile of rubble. The rubble looks somewhat familiar. They head inside and meet Dilix Mahad, an earth genie who once served as Jahvuul’s major domo. With her in her well appointed lounge in Rayheem, together they are enjoying a hooka and talking about Jahvuul and what happened when he left here.

End.
