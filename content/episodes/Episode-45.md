The party is facing a polished, shining, living brass door in the room they had just cleared of flame dwarfs. (Living brass in what most of the buildings in the plane of fire are made of, it is magically resistant to fire and will heal itself if damaged). Just before they open it a face of a grey hared, dark skinned human looking man appears in the door. It tells them cryptically that they are going the wrong way. They are in the depths of the palace and the item they seek is at the top of the highest tower. It explains that their fates are intertwined and that finding this item is key to their escape and his. They try to ask questions or make the face reappear but nothing they try seems to work.

The party shrugs their collective shoulders in meh and opens the door in front of them and find a dark cylindrical room made entirely out of living brass with stairs curving along the wall offering little protection from the open, dark, 20ft diameter pit in the center. The stairs appear to climb up further than Still’s 60ft of dark vision can see. As Still looks down, it appears there is some sort of magical darkness stopping his vision from seeing past about 20ft below their current level. Sallah asks to borrow a gold from Still… Still gives him a copper which he tosses into the pit and starts counting. The coin does not clink off a hard surface, but instead makes a sort of soft thwap noise with is follows by a roar and the clicking of many hard insect like feet on stone.

A huge insect like creature that Still point’s out actually has all the features of an insect so it’s dum that it isn’t just called an insect begins to crawl up the pit. As it’s head and grotesque undulating vein covered protrusion filled mouth come into view Still curses as he sees the creature has no eyes. A stinger tipped tail whips out of the darkness just missing Valin. The party springs into action, cursing their lack of ranged weapons. Boomer gets the ferve on. Still steps up to the ledge and tosses some throwing stars at the creature. Sallah starts dancing and breaths ice down on the creature! Valin rushes out and leaps across the pit, dodging a swipe from the creature’s claw in midair, landing a few flights down on the opposite side of the pit and takes a back hand swing at the creature as he lands.  Unfortunately, although it looked really awesome, he fails to connect with the swing. Barley get gets fly on and comes into the tunnel to line up his spell and tries some confusion on the creature, but it shakes it off..

Unfortunately, as Barley enters the tunnel the creature seems to become enraged at his presence. It lashes out at his, clawing and biting at the lamp on his belt and tearing him to shreds in the process. In a matter of seconds Barley is a lifeless Bloody pool on the ground. Lucky for him, Boomer decided to come out of the bag this day. The old gnome quickly scampers over to his fallen friend and breaths a cocaine fueled breath of life up his nose and Barely is shocked back into existence.

Sallah can now reach the creature and he starts swinging like mad, but the creatures exoskeleton proves to tough for this hammer. It seems to have a weakness for big dudes with axes though, as Valin opens him up with a full round of swings. Still follows suit with a flurry of stabs, but without the precious sneak damage its isn’t as scary as he would hope. Barley Clamors back away from the pit and boomer starts healing the little man up. Unfortunately, there is still poison in Barley’s system that the healing can do nothing about. Slowly the halflings strength starts to fade. Now the creature is a bit more concerned about the big ax then the lamp he can no longer sense. He turns his attention to Valin… but the big man’s armor is just to tough to penetrate and the creature only manages to connect with one painful claw. Unfortunately, the party now sees that the creature has regeneration as well as some of its wounds begin to close.

The next round goes much like the last, but this time around there is a big crit from the ax really making it’s presence known. The creature screams out in pain and its corpse falls back down the tunnel. Valin and Still work their way back up to get in on some of boomer healing, but before they get very far the creature comes crawling back from the pit and lashes out again… it’s regeneration bringing it back to life. Valin tries to jump the shark again… but this time doesn’t go so well. He falls short and tumbles into the blackness, bouncing off the creature a few times on his way down. Barely is pissed and tries to fireball the creature… unfortunaly he discovers at this time that all fire spell son the plane of fire are maximized, enlarged and widened. As his tiny sphere of fire impacts on the creature it explodes 40ft up and down the tunnel… bathing everyone in the party except boomer in magic flames that hurt with the power of Barley. To make matters worse, he finds the creature is immune to fire. The party quickly realizes that fire will not stop the regen and they need to try more elements. Still drops acid flasks on the creature, which seems to hurt it a bit more. They stab and beat the creature a bit more and it dies again… unfortunately falling right towards Valin at the bottom of the pit. He dodges out of the way and then confirms that the acid must have done the trick. They fish around in the pit to collect the loose treasure and a magic items down there (including a magic ring Sallah is wearing but knows nothing about (and Adam promptly forgot about 2 combats later… sorry).

The party heals up and heads to the top of the stairs. There they find another brass door which they quickly throw open. As they step into the room they are attacked by two invisible boney looking devil guys (aka bone devils but no one made their checks). The party puts them down pretty quickly, including some fun rod of wonder action with everyone taking some friendly fire from Boomer. Still gets super annoyed that again there is no sneak damage because he can’t sneak attack invisible dudes. They check the two empty treasure alcoves in the sides of the room but find no loot, so the party marches on.

The next room has 3 treasure alcoves on each side and a square room at the end of the hall with two large brass braziers glowing with large magical fires. IN the entryway to the end room, there appears to be a dead efreet hanging by his legs from a hook in the ceiling. Beyond him in the square room there are various coins and gems and a few items that detect as magic including a ring, a rug, and a bag. The party cautiously approaches the corpse and inspects it, there is nothing out of the ordinary here it is just as it seems… a dead efreet hanging from the ceiling. Sallah mage hands all the magic items out of the room. Still nothing happens. The carpet is to heavy to mage hand so Still and Sallah step into the square room. That’s when the magic fires reveal themselves as large fire elementals and two secret doors bust open behind them and lots and lots of fire elementals start pouring into the room.

In all, there are 6 large elementals, 10 small elementals, and 2 huge elementals just outside the secret doors trying to push into the room. Still swears at the sky (still no sneak attacks) as he springs into action and starts stabbing the large dudes. Sallah get in on that action as they tag team the guy. But you can’t flank an elemental either so it sucks. Barley opens up with a cone of cold… but he can feel the plane of fire resisting it (caster level check needed on all ice/water spells). He manages to get it off and just decimates the right flank killing all the small elementals and severely wounding the large and huge ones. Valin rushes up to finish off one of the large dudes and Boomer steps up and pulls out a new toy, a rod of flame extinguishing, and takes out a large guy himself.

The elementals swarm in, but the little guys can hardly do anything. The huge dudes shamble forward and manage to connect on Valin and Sallah as Still finishes up one of the Large guys in the square room and the other rushes forward. Then, a gout of flame bursts through the back wall of the square room and manifests as a gargantuan dragon made of flame. It roars in ignan that these mortals are not worthy of their blue goddess and breaths fire over everyone (except still). It hurts, but everyone lives (valin takes nothing, thanks evasion). Boomer and Valin work over the huge guy on their side as Sallah works the right and Barly backs him up with another cone of cold (this time hitting the gargantuan guy as well). It is again extremely effective and all the small and large guys are now out of the picture. Sallah, Boomer, and Valin finish off the huge guy and the party focuses in on the gargantuan dude together. They are whittling him down but he is fighting back admirably. Sallah, on fire and near death, decides to go for broke on the big guy and tells boomer to do the same… knowing that if he doesn’t drop this round there must be more breath weapon coming. His bold gamble pays off and creature drops just before he gets to act!

Everyone heals up and they gather up all the magic loot. They try to see what it is but are unsuccessful of a lot of it. They then feel around the wall and find an illusionary wall. As they pass through they find an odd sight.

“The tinkling sound of falling water and a cool spray of refreshing
mist are surprising features of this chamber. At its center stands
a large fountain, its basin composed of fire-glazed porcelain
inset with lapis lazuli and its central font constructed of marble
of the purest white. A jet of cool water gushes into the air and
falls back into the basin where it slowly drains away, causing the
gas lamps to flicker in the moisture-laden air.”

Water is rarer than diamonds on the plane of fire, so this is a strange enough sight as it is… but what happens next drops Sallah to his knees. As they enter the room, a beautiful woman made of water rises form the fountain and greets them…
“I am glad you have come my brother and other children of the Mortal Realms. Long
have I languished in this place. I am a daughter of a line of rulers
long gone from the Realm of Water. I am indeed Shazathared.

Many of your lifetimes ago was I tricked and abducted by the efreeti prince
who would now be consort to Ymeri, Queen of the Inferno. Jhavhul
was his name, and he called upon mighty magic of the ancients to
imprison me within this fountain. He wanted me first to entertain
him, but as his lust for Ymeri grew, his interest in me waned until,
finally, he ceased his visits to me altogether. I know not what
occurred, but Jhavhul has not returned in these many centuries,
and I long for the companionship of my kin.

While I know little of this palace of brass, I do know that
somewhere within it lies a source of immeasurable power—a
potent artifact hidden somewhere in the palace above our heads
whose theft has brought down the curse that traps us all here. What
it is I cannot say, other than that its presence feels like a malignant,
choking algae on the surface of a spring pool. Find this source and
either destroy it or have it taken from this place, and I feel that the
curse upon this realm will be lifted. And with it, my prison shall be
weakened. Free me my brother, and you shall forever gain the
eternal friendship of the Marid Court.”

End.
