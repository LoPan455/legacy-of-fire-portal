You heal up and talk then decide to follow after the now out of sight seed of rovagug.

As you move forward Still hears voices. He tells everyone to be quiet and he sneaks ahead.

In the chamber where father Jackel lies dead he can hear but can't see Tamir the halfling ordering some people to go tell Maysan Fajir that the Jackel is dead and the seed is loose and she should execute the escape plan. Some guards run off down the hall. Still relays the message and tells everyone to attack.

The party kills Tamir and his guards.

The party then tracks the seed to the underwater cave. Those who can swim after it.

The seed is about to get scooped up by a net. Some quick thinking (someone describe) gets the seed out of danger. Somene climbs up the rope and sees that it was a pact master ship that was trolling the net. The party assumes they knew about the cave and were just looking to catch smugglers.

You see that the one source merchant guild warehouse is on fire.

You follow the seed back to radio rayheems, where Aleeca has contained it and explains she will take it off the planet and destroy it. The pact master cleric lady thanks you for your effort and rewards you some coin for your troubles. (I want to say it was 100k, can u confirm Eric)

Rayheem says he knows someone who can get u to the plane of fire and you will go meet with her as soon as your gear is all ready for pick up.

... now fill in some sweet detail and/or things I totally left out or got wrong.
