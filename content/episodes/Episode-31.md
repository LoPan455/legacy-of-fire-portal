After relaxing, drinking, trap making, meditating in areas where certain beasts hang out, doing cocain, ect. The party is hanging out at the bar waiting for this caravan to come into town so they can then escort it back to Katapesh. The caravan is very late. Finally, a man shows up in town saying that he passed through the Oasis east of Bronze Hook (the name I couldn't remember because I think Diddy has the printed version of this map) about a week ago and there was broken wagons and rubble everywhere as if a caravan had been attacked.

The party goes to talk with Almah, and she asks them to go check it out because it would take her a few days to get her own troops organized and ready to go. Still mentions that he has heard of some bandit Cyclops known as The Kalif who was hitting a lot of caravans a few weeks back, and reminds the party that it was the kalif's band that killed Garavel.  Sallah mentions that he has heard that this Kalif has a caster in his band with a trained Ruhk (huge 2 headed birds that can swallow camels in one gulp) Current major domo, Radi Hamdi, says the PCs should not intervene, because they are already drawing unwanted attention to the area and it could be a trap. He suggests they contact the pact master in Katapesh and let them deal with it. The heroes say trap, schmap... setting of traps is what they do. They gear up and head out, all save Akbar. Akbar is a bit worried it could be a trap, so he takes that bag that has the scroll of Kakishone and says he will hang back a day or 2 and then follow just in case.

The party gears up and gets ready to head out, and everyone meets Valin's new large ape friend and Drexel's newly hatched and rapidly growing large sized giant scorpion. Drex buys a few arrows, Sallah decides to use the Lode Stone(cursed amulet of nat armor) on his meteor hammer and accept the added burden of watching out where Drexel is shooting, and the party heads out and swing by Two-Edges place for some quick trading of minor goods on the way.

A few days ride on camel back gets them to the oasis at around 10am. They are 2 days out from Bronze hook and the road has been quiet. This oasis has an old abandoned sphinx statue with a hollowed out cave in its chest where travelers usually camp to escape the heat of the day. There are a few overturned wagons about and a bunch of junk haphazardly tossed about.  Near the north side of the road there are some large broken chains and some drag marks leading off into the desert. The party dismounts. Still and Sallah go to check out these broken chains as Valin and his ape buddy go check the abandoned wagon between the oasis pool and the sphinx. As Valin and ape get over there, he spots a dot flying in the air high above the sphinx... just then the sand starts to shift around them. Then the sand erupts under Valin and the Ape as a huge sand worm busts out of the ground. Its tail busts out about 30ft away, crackling with lightning. 

Barley dismounts and throws a flame strike at the beast, but it appears to have some fire resistance. Sallah starts his dance as the beast launches lighting from its mouth to its tail right through Valin and the ape. It hurts, but not to bad. Still rushes in, but he is to far away to get a swing in this round. As he double moves toward the creature its head snaps back. Giant jaws crunch into Sallah's armor as he is lifted into the air. Valin smacks the thing, but his first blow glances off its scaly hide. The second finds purchase and the beast bleeds. Boomer rushes in, hoping to pull Still out of the creature mouth, but he is to far away. He settles on getting close enough to start the ferve for the rest of the crew. Drexel fires arrows, but the damage is very un d!ckneck like as he tries to maneuver his horse around.

Barley lays out a fireball, but with the fire protection and a successful save, the damage is minimal. The creature then swallows still. Somehow, the party senses that he has gone unconscious as he is slowly being crushed and dissolved. Still makes a stabilization check, he is no longer bleeding out but that does little to improve his situation. Boomer plans on getting himself swallowed so he can get Still out with his single DD for the day, but decides if he doesn't heal Still now he has no chance, so he channels as he moves in. Valin goes to town on the snake, with ferve attacks and gorilla aids the assault is brutal, but this is a big a$$ snake. Drexel fires and dismounts (finally) with little effect.

Barley changes over to magic missiles, and they seem to have better effect because all the damage gets through. Sallah sets up the flank for Valin and tries to get another smack in, but this thick skinned ba$tard isn't having it. The creature reaches out and picks up Valin, crunching him in his jaws.At this point, everyone in the party expects to see a sword bust out of this creatures belly, but no sword comes. So passes Stillness Filthyelf, and there is a moment of silence... Then the battle rages on. Boomer is in rage to do for Valin what he could not accomplish for poor Still. He touches Valin and dimensional hops him 10 feet back. Valin takes a step and smacks the crap out of this worm. The d!ckneck threatens to actually show up. He doesn't confirm but the arrows are many and they add up.

Somewhere int he next round of magic missiles, sword swipes, metoer hammer falls and arrows the thing dies. I don't recall who got the parting shot, but Valin is quick to gut the thing and pull out the stillest of Still's. For a moment, the party is lost in their sadness....

Then a voice in Valin's head suggests that maybe they traded some stuff with two-edge to get another one of those scrolls of raise dead. Valin and Boomer now distinctly recall trading him one of the magic axes they have for one of those.... yeah, totally that happened. Boomer whips out the scroll and Still is brought back to life.

As that happens, Still jumps up and Boomer and Sallah get to healing. As Boomer is just finishing the last stitch on Still's side, he points to the horizon (nat. 20 spot check). Still points out a cloud of dust 320ft away on the horizon. Bandits, approaching fast!

What follows is the saddest combat for the bad guys and melee fighters in the group in quite some time. Over the course of 3 rounds, so many fireballs and arrows fly out that by the time the bandits are on the board all that is left is a very wounded Ettin captain and a very wounded Cyclops. They both drop before they can even swing a weapon. The party heals up and starts looting as they watch the sky for ruhks.

End.
