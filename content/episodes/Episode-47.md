As the party loots the lizard men, the oracle crew comes back from the side room they had entered and mentions there is a stairway over there. The party notes there are 2 open passageways down the hallway in front of them and a large brass door to their right, but decide to go check out the stairs because they know the impossible eye is on the top floor. As they start to climb back down the rubble next to the ballista tower, a brass wall suddenly appears from nowhere, dividing the party.

Sallah, Barley, Damacious, and Drexel are left on the tower side of the wall. Everyone else is on the other side as they had already started heading to the room with the stairway. Barley takes a quick second to examine the wall, it was magically created. He notes that the brass door to the right is now cracked open and is about to say something when lizard men start running down the hallway toward the party. From the other side of the bass wall, he faintly hears Akbar asking if they are ok, then hears Valin yell that they have company. Not much they can do about that now though, as they have their own problems to deal with on this side of the wall.

4 firebrand lizardmen come rushing down the hallway. As these guys weren’t mush of an issue when still took them out, Barley just launches magic missels as Sallah and Damacious take the front line and Drex starts making lizard pin cushions.
The first 4 get cleaned up fairly quickly, but before they can all be cleared out 2 more exit the side rooms of the hallway and start rushing in the parties direction and he brass door to the right  kicks open and 2 Salamanders rush out. Barely realizes the back line just became another front line.

Barley blasts the salamanders, but its not quite enough. They jump him and start swinging. It hurts. Sallah stays on the lizardmen as Drex starts plugging Salamanders and Damacious does some healing. One f them goes down but the other lives to go at Barley for another round. He drops lifeless to the ground, but only for a second as Damacious magically brings the breath of life back into him. Sallah rushes the last salamander and drops him. As he I now standing near to the door he has a front row view of the 12 headed pyro-hydra rushing towards it.

Damacious puts more heal down on Barley as drex plugs the last lizard man and moves into position for a shot on the pyro hydra. Barley tells the party all about the hydra and the party curses their lack of bladed weapons as Barley blasts it and Sallah full rounds the beast.  All 12 heads look to be sucking in air getting ready to bring firey pain down on Sallah when suddenly 2 of the throats have arrows in them. This b!otch just got d!cknecked!! (crit on the 2 arrow many shot!!). More arrows fly and some triple synergy goes off in the templar weapons and the pyro-hydra is toast before it ever gets a full attack.

The party takes a second to feel awesome about itself and let damacious heal and then they push into the room the pyrohydra came from. Inside they see a large chamber with a huge brass statue of a effrit sitting cross legged. Hi eyes gleam, made of giant rubies, and a large brass bowl brazier sits in his lap bathing his face with light from below. To either side of the statue are more brass braziers sitting on pedestals. Near those are a few more salamanders. Lazily lounging in  the fire in the bowl is what looks to be a cross between  a lizard man and a t-rex wearing priest robes. The priest lazily tells the salamanders to kill these intruders as he casts a spell of blindness that barley resists.

The salamanders approach, but Barley gets the jump on them and puts confusion on one of them and the priest! The party decides to let the confusion play out for a bit and avoids attacking the priest to focus on the one non-confused salamander. He manages to get up in their face and get a hit off on Sallah before he is cut down. Unfortunately, the confused salamander also got to act normally and rushed up to get a swing on sallah as well as the cleric babbles incoherently. Damacious continues his stellar work at keeping everyone alive as the party switches focus to the second salamander. He manages to live through the round and get a full round of attacks off on Sallah before he is dropped.

Now that the room is clear, the party approaches the priest and Sallah manages to get into striking distance and get a swipe in. The metor hammer slams hard into his eye socket with a HUGE CRIT! but the cleric lives through it and he jumps from the brazier to deal a devastating full round attack on Sallah. With claw and a mighty chomp the cleric manages to put Sallah from near full to totally unconscious and almost dead.

Damacious rushes in with more healing as Drex opens fire on him. ANOTHER CRIT! This time, not as devastating because it was only with one arrow, but still… f’n d!ckneck. The cleric drops and the all is quiet. The party heals up, high fives, and then gets to looting… including plucking those huge rubies out of the statues face (which aren’t trapped!). The scene briefly seems oddly familiar… then they gather their things and head back to the brass wall to see if they can get through and help the rest of the crew.

End.
