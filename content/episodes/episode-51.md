After a good nights rest under the watchful eye of Shazathared, the part preps spells for ghost fighting, cures all their negative levels and con drain, and gets pump’t up with a cocaine feast!

They then wander back up to the courtyard above, traveling at full force out of the bag for the first time in what seems like forever. Boomer has locate object going, and it seems to be pointing them to the top of the smaller tower to the north of the main tower. They have also consulted with Vassago, the imp in the bag, and he said the deed should be in the library, which is on the ground level of the smaller tower. Just as they cross the open courtyard area of the ziggurat, a dark shadow passes over them.

A colossal red dragon is hovering high above the court yard. It begins to speak to Sallah in his head, asking him what he and all these mortals from the material plane are doing in the palace. Sallah feeds him some bs, but he isn’t buying it. Akbar speaks up too, and the dragon questions him as well. Again, there are no straight answers. No one mentions the eye, and there is a general sense of confusion about who even owns this tower.  The dragon seems to think they are thieves and that they are looking for something that belongs to the grand sultan. The dragon explains that he is the grand sultans emissary and he will have his eye on the party. There is some more witty banter and the dragon flies off.

The party continues to follow Boomers lead into the side tower. Although the locate object is telling htem to take the stairs, they are curious about the library and why the door has been locked form the outside. Still unlocks it and Valin pushes in.

There is a large, grey skinned demon looking dude standing inside some sort of circle drawn on the ground in white dust. This demon also seems to be chained by one leg to the floor inside the circle with glowing manacles. He seems mad, and demands that whoever the party is they set him free. Akbar realizes he is a Div, but doesn’t’ quite recall the detail of his particular type of div. Akbar seem to steer the conversation with him, putting on a general air of superiority and dislike. Still want to kill it and has gone invis and started moving toward the creature. Eventually, it gets agitated at the conversation and starts casting a spell. Still wins init though and rushes into the circle (despite perhaps Akbar telling him not to break the circle) and stabs the thing. It doesn’t die, and finishes off its spell pointing a finger at Akbar. A green light shoots out and turns Akbar into a pile of dust.

The party is pissed now, and everyone goes all out on the shackled creature killing it in less than 1 round. The party collects Akbra’s dust, and boomer snorts a bit of it then puts the rest into the bag. Hoping that the water genie can bring him back, the party searches the library quickly then moves on.

Heading upstairs they come across an efreet guarding a door. He says his master is in the chamber beyond and does not want to be disturbed. The party kills him and opens the door.

Inside there is a drow on a bed with a rapier. As the party moves in a small goat figurine falls from the ceiling and turns into a grotesque tentacle mouthed beast of a goat on contact with the ground. Still rushes in invis and attacks the drow, but its an illusion. The rest of the party doesn’t know that and Drexel shoots at the drow as well and misses. He changes focus to the goat beast as everyone else pushes into the room.

The goat thing attacks, asking about the one that escaped and made him aware of this realm. It grabs a bunch of people with it’s tentacles, paralyzing some of them. The party fights against the tentacle rape with escape artist checks and freedoms of movements from Damacious and Boomer. Valin gets free and smacks the thing.  An invisible creature (the drow, still can see it) talks to still, referring to him as Master Filthyelf and telling him that he is not responsible for the goat creature and that they should fight it together.  Still agrees and the invisible drow cuts him out of the tentacle that is holding him so he can rush in and sneak attack. Now that the grapple is more or less under control it takes little time for the party of 8 to slay the goat thing including some good ol’ d!ckneck critting.

The drow talks with Still, and they discuss about the master and some stuff no one understands. The drow seems to distrust still’s motives, but gives the deed over to still and then disappears. Just before it disappears it asks the party if they all knew that Still killed Garavel. The party demands some explanation and Still explains that he has been serving some erfreet lord as an assassin and has led the party to many targets given to him by this efreet in order to kill them in exchange for wishcraft enhancements. The party is a bit unsure how to take this… Valin wants to kill Still, but eventually everyone settles down and decides Still is ok and they all move on to face the ghost.   

The party heads back to the main entrance to the big tower, buffs up, and heads in . the ghost appears as always and is already pissed at them for killing him twice before. Boomer shows him the deed and starts going to town with the spiritual weapon. The ghost is super pissed and draws his weird rune to make people angry at each other then drops into the floor. A round later he appears and starts going to town on Boomer. Boomer tries and fails few times to get off the spell to make him corporeal as the rest of the party wails on him for half damage and Barly keeps up a barrage of magic missiles. D!ckneck crits again, but half damage keeps him alive…. Just long enough for Boomer to crit with his spiritual weapon for f-tons of damage. The ghost is banished for good and there was much rejoicing.

 

End.
