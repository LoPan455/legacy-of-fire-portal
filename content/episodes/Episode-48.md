The party cleans up the lizard man mess and loot and then heads back to the brass wall. On the other side it sounds like there is a scuffle going on.

 

Meanwhile, on the prison room, a fire giant and his hell hounds have come down the steps to check on the noises he has heard in the area. He finds Valin, Akbar, and Boomer hanging out in the prison room (Still is there too, but he is invisible) and rushes down to activate a trap by stepping on the bottom step of the stairwell. Runes activate all over the prison room and a strong hold person goes off, but Still manages to avoid it. As the giant heads into the room to start moving the held people into their cells an invisible Still attacks him. Unable to locate the source of the very painful attack, the giant actives the trap again… this time freezing still. But Valin breaks free after a few rounds and finishes the giant off.

 

The hounds do not advance down the stairs, so Still disables the trap as Valin begins smashing through the brass wall to let the party regroup. As they all come back around the corner, the dogs are gone. The party advances up the stairs and enters a courtyard where a half dozen fire giants, a bunch of hellhounds, and a huge Nessian war hound stand waiting for them to arrive.

 

The battle does not go well for the Giants. The Nessian warhound goes down first under focused ranged attacks. A few rounds later, all the enemies are dead and the party is hardly scratched. Valin took a lucky crit from a raging faire giant barbarian, but was quickly healed back up. As the party surveys the courtyard, they can see a large zigaraut dominating the center of the courtyard. The ceiling is open above the zigarat, and there is a railing on the edges of the opening in the ceiling and they can see the burning sky beyond that. The domes of the palace are visible to one side of the courtyard opening. It seems they are on the ground floor in the center of the walled in palace grounds and from the opening they can make out 2 large towers that rise unconnected on their upper floor. 

Akbar asks to borrow Barley’s lamp for a minute. After a bit of meditation, he beings to talk in a different voice. It appears that Vardashai has now taken over this body that was Akbar, having now been freed from imprisonment by and elder god known as The Cox, which is a writhing mass of tentacle constantly seeking orifices in its own body, worshiped by all manner of ugly creatures of short stature called the sucklota, and responsible for everything bad that happens in the world. Apparently Vardashai’s spirit was trapped in some sort of mirror where he was forced to watch the Cox, but was not actually touched in any bad way by the Cox or something like that. Somehow the power of Nefeshti released by Akbar had freed his spirit and Akbar has given his body as host to this spirit. 

Something like that.

The party scratches their heads, shrugs their shoulders, and heads off to clean out a buch of side rooms that look like they were giants and dogs quarters but are now all empty. They then decide it’s time to go take a nap. They teleport to the water genie’s spot and go to sleep.  

End.
