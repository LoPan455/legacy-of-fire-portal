As the head vampire Grand Mufti Jacub fled across the oasis, the party finished off the last 2 minor vampires, turning them both to centipede swarms. They then heal up and survey the situation.

The decide fixing the mirror first is the way to go, so a flying Zaus picks the mirror up and Boomer casts mend on it to fix it up. That taken care of, the party heads off to the graveyard to stake some vamps. Akbar stays behind for a bit to make sure the mirror is properly fixed and everyone else heads for the graveyard. 

In the creepy swamp graveyard, the party finds 3 tombs and a well. They bust into the crypts and prepare to stake some vamps as the centipedes start crawling out of the oasis. Drex stabs the first one as it appears and an invisible Still sets up across from Sallah to stab the next. As it appears Sallah starts stabbing and Still becomes visible and stabs next to him. They look straight into each other’s eyes making sure not to touch tips, then double Dutch rudder stab for a bit. Sallah notices this corpse has the green fez of a novice dervish and gets a little sad. Valin and Zaus head into the last tomb, and find 2 coffins. Zaus sets off a trap, the fire hurts. Still heads over to help stab those two as the last of the centipedes crawl out of the swamp and head that way.

Meanwhile, Boomer has been cautiously checking out the well. He floats to the bottom and sees a passageway. Drexel grabs a wand and then ties a rope to the edge of the well and starts to climb down… but for a second he forgets how to climb and falls to the floor 60ft below. As he hits the ground, he sees eyes appear amongst the boulders in the caved in section of the tunnel and undead Chupacabra emerge from the rock pile.

Sallah flies down the well and backs Drex up as they drop the first few Chupacabra. He then starts reading the inscriptions upon the wall that tell the story of this head vamp Grand Mufti Jacub and his suffering (to the tune of Skeletons of Society by Slayer). 

Valin snags a belt from one of the vamps and puts it on Zaus as Still heads for he well. Vail and Zaus are close behind. They all fly down the well and everyone starts killing Chupacabra as more emerge and a giant whip tail centipede attacks from the other end of the cave. The two-front fight isn’t much of a challenge for the party, but it does take up some time. Once they are done Akbar shows up and tells them all the mirror looks good as Sallah reads off the rest of the inscriptions and Valin and Still check the door for traps.

Session 37.5… The Grand Mufti

The door is swung open and a fire ball erupts. The Mufti is standing on his coffin and makes some quips about how you impressed him, but the curse laid here by the div will never be lifted and he will enjoy this challenge. He wins init and casts some cheaty spells (a div cursed mirror image and a div cursed haste, that give him an extra standard action per turn and the ability to go twice in init). It’s super cheaty, but the DM does it anyway. The vamp has stone skin, some sort of fire shield, and a bunch of other buffs going to. The battle is brutal, in a tight space with the mufti swinging a sword and casting a spell twice per round. There are good hits from Still and Valin, a trip from Valin, lots of magic missiles, flame strikes, force damage from Akbar, and some channel for damage from boomer.  But the Mufti’s DR, his cheating extra actions, his fast healing and his extreme accuracy with is sword are almost to much for the party to take. At one point he turns to gas to hide in his coffin and heal a bit, but as his coffin lid is thrown open he is invigorated in his attack and Valin and Sallah both fall to his blade and bleed out on the floor. Still drops, but manages to hang on to his life by a thread. But by then, the constant barrage of damage from 7 pcs with no place to maneuver to escape wears the Grand Mufti down. A final magic missile weakens him and a turn for damage from boomer, despite all the dead and dying friends around him, manages to finish him off. Barley uses mage hand to draw dawn’s swift burning from its scabbard, float it high above Jacub’s corpse, and drops it. The sword works to stake him, and the mufti is no more (of course technically if you remove the stake he would start fast healing again, but we will just ignore that).

The Pcs take a moment to collect their thoughts, heal, and let all this carnage sink in. They then loot the crap out of this dude and head back up the well. With two corpses in a bag of holding, they head to the obelisk and place dawn’s swift burning into its base. Boomer consecrated the sword and the light of the sun shines upon the oasis again. Fahdiya the Lamashatu comes flying in and bows in gratitude. Then the ghost of Pazavhunn floats over, now totally free of her madness.

Pazavhunn explains that she can speak with your dead friends, and can speak with you through her shield any time you cast speak with dead. Valin tells her to tell her brother “brother”, and that he would understand. She does, and he does. She explains that you have only begun in a great task that has been set before you. She confirms the rumors that the lamp that Barley holds is indeed Nefeshti’s prison. And she confirms that the Efreet price Jhavuul is trapped inside the realm of kakishone and that the traitor templar Davashuun has been in contact with him and is somehow helping him influence the realm from his prison. The firebleeder is stirring.

Pazavhunn explains that Nefeshti, along with many other genies, were imprisoned by the Efreet Prince Al-hassan, with the help of the great genie binder Ezer Hazzebaim. Prince Al-hassan is Jhavuul’s younger brother. He had a plan to eclipse the greatness of his lost older brother by binding 334 powerful genie and using their wishes to make him sultan of the plane of fire. He bound Nefeshti and the missing queen of the water genie, Shazathared. His plan backfired due to wishes made long ago by the current sultan, but the genie are still bound.

The binding of Nefeshti was keyed to 3 powerful artifacts. One is the tongue of the hidden, which Still retrieves off the island here at the oasis for the party. The second is the impossible eye, and the third is the scroll of kakishone itself. Only by passing into kakishone with possession of the other two items can Nefesthi be released.

The impossible eye should still be with Ezer Hazzebaim, who was last seen as a guest of Al-hassan in his palace on the plane of fire.

With all this new info, the party heals up and spends a week traveling to Katapesh. They check in at Rayhem the Otherworldly’s manor, where they are invited to stay as guests. A shifty looking merchant who represents the pact master is there at the manor meeting with Rayhem when they arrive, so they are introduced to another of Rayhem’s acolytes… a young man named Damascius. He will help them to find shops to sell their wares and anything else they might need in the city that day, and they are invited back for supper at the manor house this evening if they wish to attend. They all head out to the nearest temple of Sarenrae and trade some items for the resurrection of Sallah and Valin, and then continue on their shopping spree.

End.
