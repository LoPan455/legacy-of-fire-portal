The party rested a full 16 hours to get everyone back to full capacity and then went back up the 5ft diameter tunnel toward the throne room. Still went first to check for traps, and he found one... he set off a glyph of warding tied to a spell that yelled really loud and warned every one of their  coming. The party then decides on a plan of attack that boomer would DD Still and Valin into the room and everyone else would follow through the door.

The DD went off fine and the 3 who entered the room see it is full of 4 hyenadon mounted gnolls, 6 archers, 4 raging barbarian footmen and a big half ogre dude with a club.  Rokova and Blobog where there as well, but they were invis at the start of battle.  The group in the hole tries to exit into the room but quickly realized that the secret door into the room under the throne had been stone shaped over and the door was barred. They can’t get into the room the rest of the party DDed into already!
 
Meanwhile, Still and Valin make very quick work of the half ogre while Boomer used his new DD step ability to go over and stone shape the door open and let everyone else out of the secret door hole. Barley shoots lots of blind fireballs up the fox hole that f'ed up the mounted dudes but didn't hurt boomer thanks to Akbars protection from fire.

Rakova steps in and starts f'ing Vilan up good before boomer could get invis purge going. Akbar throws a fog cloud up the hole to mask the parties exit and more blind fireballs fly up the shaft.  Boomer gets invis purge on and everyone rapidly climbs up and out of the hole. At that point, things start falling around the heroes pretty quickly.
 
Still and Valin worked Rokova (aka Badroulbadour Templar of the downdraft) over within a few rounds. He got some hard sticks in with his wicked blade, but high AC and Valin’s stupendous fortitude saw them through (Valin got pretty low on hp but never went unconscious). Still is a little irked that he was denied the kill by a last minute arrow (or was it a spell….), but dead is dead so he gets over it quick.

Blobgob tried some dirty tricks, but all the spells were saved against and the rest of the group now free from the hole focused on and dropped Blobog the goblin cleric with ranged spells and arrows. In the end, he tries to run and stone shape an exit for himself, but the stupid goblin just makes a dent in a solid stone wall with nothing behind it in his panic and then he dies. After that, the ranged attackers turn their bow and spell attention to the 4 mounted gnolls and 4 barbarian gnolls.  In a few rounds d!ckneck and the spell slingers mop them up without issue… but at one point an arrow shot by d!ckneck veers into Valin’s back instead of its intended target. His amulet of natural armor flashes with a weird light as it happens. Luckily it wasn’t a crit… but an arrow in the back never feels to good.  

As Rakova drops, the remaining gnolls (6 archers) all run and the fight is over. The party starts a mad rush to loot and identify.  

On Rokova, Still got his Templar weapon (gloaming) which is sweet for sneak attacks with lots of bleeding special abilities. Blobog had a ring on him especially for boomer that makes stick clouds with fart noises (see attached).

It also became clear that the amulet of nat armor from the stegopeded that Valin is wearing is cursed. Akbar re-identified it as the lode stone... see attached. Valin will need a remove curse you want to get it off, but Sallah may want to keep it.

As for general status... you re-cleared the throne room but are still standing in it and recovering after spending a few minutes looting and identifying stuff. Some need healing yet… You are still not out of the house of the beast.
