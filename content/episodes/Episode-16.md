As the caravan from Katapesh rolled back into town, bringing back Still and Sallah, dozens of new citizens, building materials, supplies, and the parties new +2 stat boosting items... the party got together to discuss what happened over their downtime. 

The first thing the party and Almah noticed was that Garavel wasn't with the caravan. Still explained that there was a pact master guard named Shawn that was running his mouth the whole way back to Kelmarene, and that then the first time they had tried to head back, the caravan was attacked by bandits who may have worked for a Cyclops in the area and Garavel was killed in the attack. Sallah explains that he was not on that trip due to delays in Kelmarene. Almah is upset, but there is a new Major Domo here now sent by the pact masters, he goes by the name Radi Hamdi. Also with him has come a pact master guard captain named Zadeem and 16 pact master guards now assigned to Kelmarene under his command. Almah and these new pact master reps go off to discuss business, and the party goes to the bar to discuss downtime happenings. 

Valin explained that he had chosen the gatehouse as the parties headquarters (the building with the little bridge on lvl 2 that had served as a gnoll watchtower). He had started clearing it out, and had also taken note of the last few howlings (that would be the weekly gnoll howling session that is used to communicate back with the carrion king). The 3 jaw clan had let word out that Kelmarene had fallen to humans. It doesn't seem much action would be taken in response as the 3 jaws were told to just sit tight. There is expected to be another howling this evening. 

Drexel had been out ranging to the south, where he found a friendly circle of druids he befriended. They helped him piece together a map of the area and explained that the gnolls use white stone and snake canyons as their major through fairs in the area, and that the carrion king's base of operations is located at the house of the beast on the east side of pale mountain. He also learned that there isn't a stone druid somewhere up in the peaks that is very protective of her grove but isn't necessarily evil. 

Sallah shows off his new golden Fez, which he has been honored with by the dervish chapter of Katapesh. 

Still and Sallah explain that Nobody has decided to stay behind in Katapesh for a bit to study, and that they were attacked by 2 headed birds a few days out from Kelmarene. Without magic support it was slow going for the pact master guards to take the birds out with bows, but this little Halfling known as Barley Stormhands helped get Sallah and Still airborne and was a great help. The party talk to him and he seems cool. 

Boomer has spent his time mastering the use of the Infusium, using Rockso as a test subject. 

Akbar is no where to be seen, it is assumed he is off studying some frescoes or something. 

Still brings up that in Katapesh he heard of some dwarven mines near a lake in the brazen peaks that are supposed to be the den of some salamanders but also hold great treasure. He mentions that the party should go check them out soon. Drexel uses a new bird toy he has to confirm the location of "tarn lake" on his map with the druids.

Finally, the party decides that they should go torture the gnoll bartender for a bit and Still and Sallah go all bad cop / good cop on him and he tells them everything he knows... which is not much. He explains that the carrion king is in the house of the beast and that the howl happens weekly to pass info. He explains that there are countess tribes serving the carrion king, the largest of them being the White Fur and the Witches Brood. Sallah asks why there aren't any gnoll casters, he explains that most gnolls are superstitious and either kill their magic users or exile them. The brood has many casters though. I think that's all the important info he gave you. 

As the howl goes out that night, iot is noted that there is no response from the old fort that the 3 jaw clan had occupied. In the morning, black smoke is seen rising from that general area and 2 large minotaurs, one with a hammer and one with a great sword, are at the bridge in town arguing with some pact master guards and Zadeem. The party rushes to the scene. 
 
The minotaurs just want to come into town to trade and drink. They say they have information for the leader of the town, but they will only give it to the leader. Zadem is very against letting them in, but the PCs think as long as they drop their weapons it seems ok so they can talk to them. The minotaurs do that and come into the battle market. The party convinces them that still is the leader, and the minotaurs tell them that the kobold king has returned and that his town is next.... but are then quickly distracted by the battle stage. They ask if the PCs follow battle market tradition, to which they answer yes. One of the minotaurs then runs a random moop citizen through with his horn and immediately puts his hands up and says "I demand trial by combat!" 

Well, he kind of gets his wish. The PCs draw weapons and hack him to pieces before he can even fully stand up. His brother gets one charge in before his is an equally bloodied and electrically charred husk. The party decides they better go to the fort and find out what's going on. They invite Barley to tag along. 

At the fort location, they climb the steps next to the falls to the camp area. There are more steps up from there on the far side of camp that lead to the 3 story tower that runs up to the top of the falls. In the camp, they fight some kobolds. The kobolds in the first round run up and kick at the gnoll corpses littering the ground and tell them to "get up, they serve to kobold king now and its time to fight". The corpses rise as undead zombies and join the fight. There is also a gargantuan beetle in  the stables that appears to be used by the kobbolds as transportation. Most of the kobolds, zombies, and the beetles are blinded by the Halfling and then hacked, smashed, burned to death in fairly quick order. Valin got a bit low on HP a few times, but boomer kept him swinging. In the middle of the fight, a huge undead dragon stood up on top of the tower and shot lightning breath at the party. He hasn't come down to join the fight and as it stands all the moops in the camp are dead and the PCs are left staring up at the top of the tower. 

end.
