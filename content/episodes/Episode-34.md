The party decides to forgo resting and chase after the retreating vamps in centipede form. They assume that the vamps are heading for the graveyard across the lake, but decide to walk along the northern shore and check out the strange monolith on the way there.

Upon arriving at the monolith the party noticed another one of those strange dark clouds floating near the top, and also a dark pool of shadow at its base. The pool of shadows at the base seemed to be feeding the cloud above thought wisps of shadow smoke that curled up the monolith. There is ancient writing all over the monolith that no one could quite make out, and it appears that some of it has been defaced. One symbol near the base showed an image of a sword plunged into the ground at the base of the monolith with a symbol of the sun behind it, leading Boomer to believe that there is a sword that goes here that could banish the darkness.

Before anyone could do anything about that ghouls rose from the lake again and attacked the party. They were fought off without much issue, but were soon joined by a creature of unknown origin. It seemed to be an outsider of some sort but no one could identify it. It looked like the creature form the black lagoon all covered in spikes and was obviously aquatic. It carried a spear and tried to stab and poison people and let out a cloud of stink. It put up a good fight, but the party put it down. Unfortunately, Sallah was hit by friendly fire in the fight (oops).

After it died, Valin took the sword the party had found in the temple and tried to stab it into the center of the swirling mist. It hit something hard. Fishing around under the mist, Valin pulled out a magic shield. This was obviously Pavashun’s templar weapon and Boomer felt an immediate affinity to it and immediately put it on. After moving the shield, Valin tried plunging the sword down again. It sunk into a hole in the rock, like it was meant to go there. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen.

The party was left contemplating why this didn’t fix everything and deciding what they should do next.

End.
