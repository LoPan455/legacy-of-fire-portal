Boomer sleeps and preps. Sallah and Baleena show up on the scene ready for a fight. Valin and Akbar decide they are going to sit this one out in case you all run again so maybe they can do clean up.

Boomer preps many remove fear spells and deathward spells. He gets remove fear going on Still and Sallah to give them a save bonus against the fear. He saves some to catch anyone who starts running. The party buffs up and heads in for round 3.

It’s a long, drawn out fight as more and more cinder ghouls keep swarming the scene. But with the help from the Boomer buffs, the party is able to hold the line without running. Still and Sallah are able to tag team the first smoke golem easily. The remaining two head in to gang up on them and put up a good fight, trying to enter their lungs. With backup from Drex’s arrows and Ballena holding their backs to prevent the cinder ghouls from wrapping around the front liners with support from Boomers heals and flanks finally drop the last 2 smoke golems.

Akbar arrives on the scene and starts the area effect holy smites back up to help with cleanup. It takes a few round, but eventually everything in the city goes quiet. After 3 attempts, what seems like an army of cinder ghouls are finally dead.

The party heals up, and sallah, akbar and boomer move in on the fountain. Boomer is the first to grab a crystal. As he does the fountain crumbles into a dark hole that forms below it. A deep well lies below the fountain and something begins to rise from its dark depth. Suddenly, a wall of force 50ft in diameter surround the fountain.

A death tyrant rises from the well, its skull grinning with malice and its red undead eyes scanning the party.

End.
