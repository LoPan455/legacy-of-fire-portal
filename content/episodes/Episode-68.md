After arriving back at the brass palace, a night is spent in morning and revelry. Morning because it appears that with the death of the creators, the Luciferno has stopped reforming itself and Capt. Riddle, Sweetie Mae, and the loyal Cabin Boy will not be coming back. Revelry for the fact that the creator’s plot to dissolve this world has been stopped. What will become of the changelings is anyone’s guess, but for now they appear to be the same as they always were. Many drinks are had, some out of this new teal spoon the party is carrying about and as the night winds on, who knows what other mischief that spoon got into.

In the morning, Boomer has his break enchantment ready and the party is prepped for the plunge into the swirling maelstrom that guards both the horde of the great turtle and the water node. Still is brought back to his full elf glory, plans are made to contact Rayheem so that he and Dilix-Mahad can meet you at the water node once the portal is open, and the party flies on the colored wind to meet up with Oberhak.

Oberhak is grateful that the creators have been destroyed, and treats the party with much more respect and admiration than he once did. He agrees to hold up to his side of the bargain, but he will not swim through water like some sort of water genie. He and his party will travel through the rock of the earth and meet you at the node.

Baleena is given another scroll of teleport, Boomer gives everyone water breathing, and the party ports to the maelstrom and jumps in.

Below the surface of the wine sea, there is a large cave just off to the side of the maelstrom. The party swims over and finds a small pocket of air at the top of a very deep cave. Hundreds of feet below the part can just make out a turn in the pit, and they assume this is the way they need to go. But between them and their goal swim 2 huge sharks. Akbar begins to have trouble swimming and falls behind as the rest of the party slowly advances on the sharks. Boomer gets some ferve going so people can have some extra speed, and Beleena summons 6 horse, who appear under the water and instantly panicked. The horses swim towards the surface in a frantic pack… a perfect distraction to draw the sharks into range. But Valin has other plans and he activates his boots of speed and with that and the ferve he swims like a glorious merman and taking the dagger he had clinched in is teeth he begins stabbing. Still and Sallah arent’ about to let him get all the fun, so they swim as fast as they can to catch up. Meanwhile, Boomer and Baleena are not able to match pace with the stronger swimmers and start falling far behind. Drex begins firing underwater arrows, but they have no effect when traveling through so much water.

The sharks start to feed, and they quickly swallow up Valin and Still. Unfortunately for the sharks, this is not these guys first time in a stomach and both sharks soon have 2nd assholes as the heros swim back out and keep stabbing. What follows is a gory blood bath of teeth and daggers. Valin is hit hard and is almost chewed right in half but in the end the sharks lifeless bodies float up among the now even more terrified horses and Boomer is able to catch up with the melee fighters and patch them up.

End.
