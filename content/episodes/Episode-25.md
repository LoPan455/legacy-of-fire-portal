As glitterdust settled on the firesnakes from Barley’s tiny hand, Still smirked. The eyes on the furthest one had glosses over and Still let the rest of the party know he had that one on lock down if they could deal with the other. He rushed over and got to work with his blades, darting away quickly with each attack to avoid getting singed with the burning flesh. Sallah moved in on one of the remaining mounted gnolls and laid into it with spinning hammers. Valin was still looking pretty rough from that scorpion fight, so Akbar and boomer set to work getting him up on his feet as he drank a potion before the snakes could close. The gnolls who had released the scorpion all retreated back into the western doors of the big dome and slammed them shut. On eo fthe 2 still mounted gnolls closest to the group and the one gnoll who had already lost is mount closed in on Sallah and Valin. The last one spurred his hyenadon forward in a charge at Barley. His movement cost him his mount at the hands of the whirling dervish hammer. As the gnolls and hyenadons attacked, they seemed to find luck in stabbing and crunching the wounded Valin, undoing all the healing work that just happened. Drexel plugged the remaining hyenadon, barely doing any damage as the poison from big mama deathstalker was still coursing through his veins. He was getting weaker by the second and he had a hard time adjusting to shooting arrows without full strength. Barley threw magic missiles at the snake and started slowly backing away. The blind snake swung wildly looking for Still but finding no purchase. The other moved in next to a wall and looked down at the injured Valin with delight. He started striking with vicious accuracy and Valin lost consciousness.
 

Still continued to work the blind snake, darting left and right and sticking lungs and livers with expert precision. Sallah danced and whirled, taking out the hyenadon that bit Valin then wrapping around behind the fire snake that was eating him. Akbar and Boomer again spent a round trying to get Valin on his feet, and Valin took a heavy swing at the snake from the ground, carving out a large chunk of flesh. The 2 closest gnolls rushed at Akbar, and he took a grazing from a spear. With Sallah out of the way, the 3rd gnoll continued his rush at Barley, but the little one was too quick for him. Boomer stabilized Valin, but left him unconscious in hopes that the snake would pick a different target. Drexel picked off the gnoll chasing after Barley and Akbar zapped a second one out of existence with lightning. Barley continued to magic missile the snake, and the snake slowly started to work its way around the wall in his direction, taking a quick strike at Sallah as it moved. The blind snake again missed Still and Still turned his attention to the other snake.
 

Sallah provided a flank as Still rushed in and struck deep on the snake that dropped Valin, but the snake got in a quick jab on the ninja as he approached. Sallah danced and lashed out with his big balls and Akbar zapped the snake with lighting. The remaining Gnolls jabbed ineffectively with spears and Drex and Barley opened fire on the snakes. Somewhere in that round of slashing, burning, and smashing both snakes dropped. One of them got drexeled but in the chaos of combat I don’t recall who dropped the other. Akbar and Boomer got Valin on his feet as Sallah Still and Drex finished off the remaining tow gnolls and everyone took a quick sigh of relief and started healing. Besides the daddy scorpion inside the dome protecting its eggs, the courtyard help only heroes and corpses for a few brief seconds.
 

Some healing happened and Sallah tried to shit the big scorpion doors. Again, no one wanted to help Sallah and not much happened with the doors : ) Then, the door that the blind circle gnolls had retreated through burst open, and the 4 circle gnolls who had been blinded before fanned back out intot he courtyard.
 

The circle gnolls were still pretty far away, so the party took another round to get healing in. Valin got close to full and everyone else was brought all the way up.  The circle archers continued to fan out, and they were joined by what looked like 3 casters rushing out the door and spreading to avoid fireballs.  
Still and Sallah both went invis and started rushing in the shortest path toward the archers, but they couldn’t get there this round. Akbar tried to follow but couldn’t quite jup the low walls like the dancer and ninja could so he lagged behind. Valin decided to wrap around the pool to the south and come in the back side. He ran off in that direction, drinking one last heal potion as he did. Drexel and Barley took up position behind the short wall, and arrows and the last fireball flew dropping 2 of the archers and one caster and wounding many others even though it was the worst fireball roll ever seen.  A final gnoll exited the building, he seemed to hold a commanding presence over the others, wearing wicked heavy armor with a large bloody circle covering the breastplate. He gripped his holy symbol and cast mirror image on himself. The archers moved forward and open fired on Barley. At least one arrow found flesh. Then the 2 casters moved up, both connecting on the little Halfling with magic missiles.  Barley went down.
 

Still rushed forward and took out an archer…  he went invis again but that marked his last round of invisibility for the day. Sallah continued to move forward invis, getting behind the cleric. Akbar moved forward and laid out a cone fire on the remaining archer, Still, and one of the casters. They all made the save and took minimal damage. Valin continued to rush around the fountain, ending within charge range of the cleric. Drex fired arrows, but round after round of poison (6 to be exact) has done a number on his strength. The arrows do minimal damage. Barely fires magic missiles at the cleric and ducks behind the walls as boomer uses his last spell of the day to give the little man some hps. The gnoll archer fires ineffectively at Akbar as the casters shoot flame strikes at Valin and start to back up to cut him off. The cleric throws blindness spell at Valin, but he shakes it off.
 

Sallah executes his master plan. Dropping his chain, he grows his claws and leaps at the cleric in an attempt to grapple it. But the cleric has blur and mirror image going, and Sallah lands on the ground next to him only managing to blink out an image. Valin moves closer, now in charge range. Still drops a caster and now stands in the open, too far away to charge at the cleric next round. Akbar calls more lighting and Barley launches his last magic missile into the cleric. Drex still just can’t connect with his bow as Boomer channels to try and get barley more hps. The cleric calls a chain of force into existence and it strikes out at Sallah but misses. More arrows fly at Akbar, this time one sticks for minimal damage. The last caster moves back toward Sallah and attempts a shocking grasp but can’t connect.
 

Again, Sallah tries to grab the cleric… this time connecting with the actual creature. But the cleric is tougher than he looks and manages to shake him off. Still moves in and strikes at the caster, taking him out. Valin rushes forward and smashes his ax into the clerics armor. For a second it appears that the armor is to strong, even for Valin’s mightly blow… then Valin sees that this creature is actually a yuan ti, a monstrous humanoid, and his extra hate for them brings the ax through (ac 28, no joke).  Drex fires more ineffective arrows and barley heals himself up a bit as boomer starts running off toward the cleric scuffle. The cleric takes a step back and casts a spell at Valin. A voice in his head tells Valin to kill Sallah and he must obey. Just then, the last remaining archer fires an arrow at Akbar. It’s a lucky shot right through the temple (CRIT!) and Akbars brains are splattered across the courtyard (very dead). The chain of force again strikes out at Sallah and this time knocks him to the floor.
 

Things were looking bad. The rage of seeing his brother fall gives Valin a second save, but he fails again. Valin smacks Sallah hard and Sallah is down to 12 hp and prone. He can’t stand or move, which means he can’t get a flank in for Still. He sees his only option is to play dead, which he is hoping means Valin won’t attack again. He plays opossum better than any man you have ever seen (nat 20!) and even Still thinks he is dead. Still takes a full withdraw, hoping that he can scouts charge next round to get sneak damage.  Barley uses his last spell of the day to try to drop glitterdust on Valin and the cleric, but they both make their save and there is no effect. Sallah’s plan works, and Valin does not attack him, but both the cleric and Valin are now staring at Still who is standing out there on his own at least 120 feet away from any of his living, uncontrolled friends. All hope seems lost… and then D!ckneck decides to show up!
 

20, 19, 20. That was the to hit with many shot, the confirmation roll for a 2 arrow crit, and the following rapid shot attack roll. It was almost 2 crit an a row. The cleric got drexeled in a last minute hail Mary, we are all probably going to die situation. IT WAS CRAZY! The clerics head just explodes with that massive amount of arrow damage and all the heroes sheer!
 

Valin was no longer dominated and he and Still made quick work of the last 2 dudes. The party looted like crazy for a few rounds, grabbed up Akbars body, and ran for the behir cave, with Drexel and Valin covering all their tracks as they went. (loot list to follow).
 

 Songs will be sung for ages about this morning of carnage and bloodshed of epic proportion beneath the rising sun high on the slopes of pale mountain. There is no doubt that the gods took pause and watched over you this morning. The rough beast, Rovagug, stirred in his prison, delighting in the bloodshed and chaos regardless of who was the victor. But the light of the Dawn Flower, Sarenrae, burned brighter at the end of a hard won victory over the forces of evil and chaos. In a matter of minutes that seemed like weeks, the control of the courtyard ebbed and flowed between overwhelming victory, terror and near death, heroics in the face of overwhelming odds leading to a hard fought win which after only a moments respite turned again into a crushing defeat and the death of a friend and brother, and then back again to a last minute success. As you leave this place, you leave behind a scene of complete carnage and the vultures begin to circle. They will eat well.

 
End.
