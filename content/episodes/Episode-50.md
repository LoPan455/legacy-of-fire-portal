There is some brief further exploring of the bass bull to be sure nothing was missed, and the party stops to survey all their options in this courtyard. A large shadow passes briefly over them, and glancing up someone catches a glimpse of a colossal red dragon flying over head with one eye looking squarely down at the palace. There is some thought that this may be a servant of the Grand Sultan starting to check things out.

Looking around, it appears there are doorways leading into an enclosed area of the courtyard that does not seem to group much higher than the next level of the courtyard above. There are 2 entrances into what appears to be the smaller of 2 tall towers that rise side by side and form the main palace. Then there are large, ornate brass double doors that lead into the center of the largest tower. They party debates for a bit, then decides that because the impossible eye is supposed to be at the top of the tallest tower they should go that way first and find it, then they can come back and look for loot in the other areas. They go to the big brass doors and before they open them Ezer Hazzabeim appears again and tells them some cryptic crap about “The chief eunuch of old sits upon a throne that is not his own, but his old master’s covetousness has taken hold of his soul. If his claim upon his master’s holdings can be disproved, he is without his immortal anchor and can be slain.”


The party throws open the doors and finds themselves in the main throne room of the palace. There is a big throne, 2 smaller thrones, a pit behind the throne, and a few large fire pits. A ghost appears on the throne, claiming that he rules iron town. He asks the party to kneel before the ruler of this palace. The party scoffs at him.  He appears to have once been a dwarf but is now large sized and a ghost. Some smaller ghost like things appear in the other chairs and they all attack.



The party tries talking to him about how dumb he is, but apparently that isn’t going to work. They realize they will need some substantial proof that he doesn’t own this place. Attacking his ghosty body is slow going, but Boomer’s spiritual weapon seems to work wonders. His attack is painful and takes levels from some people, but after much effort he is destroyed. Not knowing how long they have until he comes back, the party does a quick search and shuffles out the back door.



They find themselves in a beautiful garden that shouldn’t be here on the plane of fire. There is a nice little stream and a big conifer tree. There are also 2 large dire tigers that try to eat them. Their attack hurts sallah pretty bad and there are also some big dragon flies that come out of the tree. The party puts the smack down and then heals up and heads out the other door.



This leads to a staircase that puts them back into the throne room, only now they are higher up on the balcony 50ft above the floor they entered on. There is a dark hallway leading out of the room that they party can’t see the end of, and a single door to the side of that. The d!ckless ghost reappears and floats up to attack again. It’s just as painful as before and the party isn’t enjoying it. They decide to rush into the door to see if maybe he can’t follow them as Boomer gets his spiritual weapon going again. The running away doesn’t work as the ghost comes through the wall and presses the attack. More people get more negative levels but eventually they put him down again. They door led to a small sleeping quarters that looks like it used to belong to the dwarf ghost. They realize he must have been a duergar, because all his clothes are medium size and duergar can change size at will. Akardishai mumbles under his breath about the Cox as he looks at a poster of some rock god duergar of old.  They do a thorough check of the room to see if they can find some legal documents about who owns the castle or some ring or noble symbol or something. They find a septor that is pretty cool, but it doesn’t prove ownership in any way. Other than that it’s just a bunch of clothes. They loot all they can and head out down the dark hallway.



 At the end of the dark hallway they find a f’ed up dark effreeti demon thing gorging itself of old rotten food from a feat that had been set out in a banquet hall and has now all gone to rot. The fest hall has many windows in it, but they all appear to have heavy drapes pulled over them making the room pitch black. As it notices their approach, it mentions something about finding something beater to eat. It attacks, as do the dread wrathes that appear next to it.



It’s a nasty looking thing, but the con drain form the dread wrathes is what hits the party the hardest. Focused fire of sneak attacks, arrows, axes and searing light work the big guy over pretty quickly. He catches Valin and Still up is a lightning dust storm. Valin pushes through and gets out, and the creature dies before he can do any serious damage to Still. The wrathes linger for a bit and put some serious constitution hurt on everyone, but they are eventually put down with again a lot of help from that spiritual weapon and searing light.



As the party catches their breath, they hear a familiar laughing from the throne room behind them. The ethereal d!ckless pain in the a$$ is back. The party quickly decides its time to rest and come up with a new strategy here, and Boomer teleports the party back to the fountain room to lick their wounds and DING LEVEL 11!!!



End.
