After a nice long rest, the party wakes up and Sallah tells them they should all drink from the fountain. They feel a coolness go through them. Later they find out that they are all now immune to fire due to wish craft (thanks Sallah). 

They head back upstairs and decide to explore a side door they hadn’t checked out before heading back into the courtyard. Inside they find a dead fire giant, and some arrow slits looking out onto the streets of the city of brass and into a large dark stairway which they assume must lead from the main gates of the palace into the courtyard they fought the fire giants in. Looking through the arrow slits into the stairwell, Valin spots a strange creature, which someone in the party identifies as a creature form a different plane of existence known as a beholder. It’s wicked bad but details are sparse. As the beholder turns the party feels their magic stuff stop working, so they assume it can cancel magic out with its gaze. They decide not to f with it. 

Damacisous asks the dead giant some questions. He doesn’t seem to know much about what he wants to know. He confirms that he was killed in a revolt by the salamanders. The party already killed all of them in the temple room. He doesn’t know jack about the impossible eye or where it is. The party gets board and heads back to through the dungeon room and up into the courtyard to go check out that zigaraut. 

They head into the courtyard and approach the base of the zigaraut, but the giants there do not leave its side to attack the party. They do start throwing rock though, which kind of hurt. As the party approaches, they notice that a large stairway that enters the courtyard to the side of the zigaraut looks really familiar… then a beholder comes up it. At the same time, a larger giant made of brass and 2 really big chimera appear on the railing overlooking the Zigaraut from above. The brass giant says some banter about how the invaders will all be killed. The beholder then remembers he was supposed to do some banter, and casually introduces himself as karl and apologizes that he is wishbound to kill the party. 

As Karl approaches, everyone scatters. Akbar/Varishai is caught in the center of his gaze. Karl attacks and causes him to panic and run and hide. The rest of the party manages to make saves against a lot of Karl’s most horrible eye rays… including disintegrate that Sallah avoids and a flesh to stone that Akbar shakes off. Eventually Still and Sallah work their way around the back side and Karl goes down. Valin and drex take care of the fire giants and Damacious climbs up to the brass bull and rides on top of it just in case something cool happens if he does (and to look really awesome). Meanwhile, the Chimera have started swooping attacks that really hurt so Drex has shifted focus to them. Boomer’s spiritual weapon is flying around hurting the big giant as he throws heavy, painful brass balls at people. A well timed jump and some well planned prepped actions put the chimera down, and Drex steps out from under the railing to start nailing the Brass giant. He gets a good dickneck crit on it, but it’s still alive and it jumps down to smash him with a giant hammer almost one shotting Drex into a pile of goo. Sallah and Still rush in with lightning speed to help the party manages to kill the thing before he finishes off Drex.

  Akbar/Vardishai gets his courage back and the party gathers at the brass bull and opens it up. They find it is a torture devise and a near dead effreet is inside. They put it out of its misery then Damacious asks it more questions. They learn there is some Drow around here that had something to do with the salamander revolt and the giants also turned on the effreet or something like that. 



End.
