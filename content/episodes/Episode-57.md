# Episode 57: Three Tounds with The Beast and the Quattoing #

After their failure fighting the golden beast, the party sits on the beach drinking mai tais and contemplating their next move. Valin, Akbar, and Barley are nowhere to be seen. It’s assumed they may have warped to a different waypoint. The party tries to contact them but it doesn’t work for some reason.

A plan is hatched to buff up and avoid being swallowed or grappled by the beast so more rounds can be fought at full damage potential. Much buffing is done magic weapon wise and freedom of movement wise and the party (Still, Boomer, Sallah, Drexel and Bellina)  teleport to the cave ready to fight.

For a few rounds, things go according to plan. There are no ragdolls flopping around in the beast's mouth or human jellybeans… but quickly it becomes clear that the damage output from the party, although substantial, is quickly being outpaced by the powerful jaws of the beast. With no one occupying said jaws in ragdoll form the gnawing is relentless. One by one the party members drop, limbs torn from bodies and gaping holes in torsos. As each body drops, the buff spells subside and the corpses are quickly devoured. It does not go according to plan and soon the party is back at the gazebo taking copious amounts of tequila and weed and trying to forget.

In their altered state of mind, Sallah and Still come to a joint realization that the secrets are IN the computer. They realize when they were in the beast's belly, the damage being dealt was far less than it was outside the body. In fact, most of that damage was acid damage as well… easily protected against. The party sleeps off their dream quest, buffs up for acid protection and DPR with one handed weapons and much like Zues when he sees a sexy virgin cow, boomer teleports the party directly inside the beast.
