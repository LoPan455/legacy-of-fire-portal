It’s a beach party Kakishone
Snorkling with the hydras mon
Eating magic mushrooms from the basin

Valin and Sallah were feeling pretty swell
When Sallah got a message from a clockwork shell
It said get d!ckneck and all your friend
You’re going hunting, right after your

Hey Valin, aren’t you going to get busy with all those hot captured ladies?
Oh, I’m afraid we can’t do that, Boomer
Why Not?
‘Cause they don’t have any legs! AAAAAH

The party landed on a beach in Kakishone. Killed a hydra. 
Found out none of their magic items are working (but spell casting works fine). 
Then got a mission from a clockwork turtle to hunt down "the golden beast" via some message. 
When the turtle opened there were 2 scrolls, a really old one about hunting the golden 
beast and getting its horn, and a newer one about proving your good enough to be an 
ally:

Welcome Travelers from Lands Unknown. 

Your arrival is quite the mystery and will surly change both our fates. 
Long ago, visitors to these islands received a greeting from The Imprisoner. 
He is long gone now, but his world remains. A world that we created. 
You have only just arrived so we must test your strength and character to 
know if you are to be our ally or our enemy, capable or inept. 
Complete the Imprisoner’s task, as outlined in his message of old, 
then use the golden egg to seek us out. 
The boatman will know what is to be done with it. 
We leave you with these gifts. 
If you are capable allies you will know what they are for and 
perhaps not need to use them. We wish you well, and look forward to 
further discussion.

Message on old weathered scroll…

Greetings and welcome, brave hunters, to the Serpent Isles. 
Here you will find a hunt to satisfy your thirst for 
challenge, danger, and adventure. 
A tale to be told as you relax at the Pleasure Palace as my guest. 
Your task is simple: you must hunt down the Golden Beast 
that stalks these lands and 
take its horns. There are many challenges to be faced on these islands, 
but only by sounding the golden horn can you call back the ship that will
 bear thee hence. Do not think to cheat the hunt, 
 as the Golden Beast is under my protection. 
 This is a test of skill, courage, cunning and power. 
 One horn you must sound at the pier and present to the 
 boatman to gain passage from this island. 
 The other horn is yours to keep, as a trophy and reward for your daring. 

May the fickle hand of fate smile upon you and guide you.

The party hung out at a sweet gazebo/hut on the beach with a basin that made anythign they wanted to eat or drink, and cabinet that made anythign they wanted to wearwhile. Akbar got some sun glasses and board shorts and did some snorkeling in the coral reef while everyone else got some armor as needed (all non-magical) and ate a bunch of cookies, some magic mushrooms, and drank.   
After playing with magic basins that generated anything you wanted to eat or wear in the sweet gazebo for a while, Valin asked for a cookie shaped like the golden beast. Sallah said it looked like the Tarresque (a child of rovagug, a legendary beast thought to herald the end of the world… kind of like Xotani the Fire Bleeder who is also a child of Rovagug).
The party went hunting through the jungle, found some tracks and followed them for a while, then heard a call for help. Ran off to see what was happening, it was a trap. The women who appeared to be burning at the stake turned out to be snake people in league with their snake people “captors”. The party totally knew they would be but played along anyway. All snake people are now dead.
End.
