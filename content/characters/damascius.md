## My beginnings, 20th moon of Arodus

For those who wonder, this is my story in hopes to figure out this mystery haunting me all my life.  My family lineage comes from Qadira, specifically I was born and raised in the city of Katheer.  My childhood was spent learning religion and discipline, or at least it was tried on me.  Shortly after my 10th year of life my actions started to disturb my parents and teachers.  It was not academics that was disturbing them, but the supernatural occurrences that were happening around me or because of me.  Since my father was a firm believer in the future of science and pragmatism within our religion, I was sent to finish my studies elsewhere.

At the end of the year my trip was planned and after my goodbyes was put on a ship headed for the city of Azir.  My father still had friends from before his marriage to my mother.  My mother is zealous about Sarenrae, but my father had always been a skeptic, thus the decision to raise me under Law and Logic.  

My journey to Azir was rather uneventful, other than I was seasick almost the entire journey, of which I will never travel by sea again.  I was met by Narhodean at the port and was to live with him until I was able to establish myself with one of the schools.  The schooling for an outsider was tough, and because I did not have roots in the city, was forced to sharpen my wit and mostly kept to myself.  Eventually I landed a place in the school called Doctrina Critica Universalis.  I had the marks to achieve great success at any school, but no other school would take me, so I relinquished.  The admission office did not state it, but I got the sense that there was too much liability in taking my admission for their school, being a foreigner and having an unknown religious background (of which I did not mention my mom or the history of her zealous devotion).  The DCU was a startup school and, having an Aasimar dean after all, was more willing to take a risk.

Living at the school, my days spent mostly learning while all the other students went out and lived life, learning from doing, taking up trades, and experiencing relationships, and normal things people learn to get by.  My fun was to debate, converse, and learn how to get what I wanted from the teachers.  Soon enough I was teaching some of my own young students when my past came back to haunt me.  As I got older my affinity for the antiquity grew and so I started to learn how to defend myself.  Starting with the basics, was taught about equipment, and finally how to wield a spear which is my favorite weapon.

About the time I had 30 years of life my life started to encounter strange occurrences which brought me back to my childhood.   By this time I was studying each new book that arrived into the school and had a class of students that I was teaching primary philosophy.  Never did I think to move into a place in the city, but kept my dorm on campus.  There is where my strange episodes resurged.  Each morning I would find that my belonging had moved from where I set them.  At first I stopped drinking heavily, which is a bad habit I learned, but then it was weird placement of objects.  Next, I thought it was a riddle that the other teachers were playing, but after people started to think of me as crazy, I started to keep it to myself.  As the months went by, fatigue was growing on me and I had yet to solve this strange mystery.  Eventually I gave up and started to live with it as if it was a pet friend.

These occurrences had been harmless until I was confronted by the administration about an event that I was responsible for, a book to be precise, for which I was pointed as the author.  To this day I deny all blame of authorship, but have in possession said book: corpus areopagithicum

The problem was this book held writings that started to inspire the zealous nature of religious faith.  People started to talk about faith again in a city was strictly forbid it, and now I was to blame.  Soon the secular administration was looking at our school and the school did not want any negative publicity so they handed me over to the authorities.  After much debate and diplomatic means, I was able to prevent any arrest, but I knew it would not last.

I was in the shop buying my ration of wine when I saw from the window a preacher leading a revival of some sort in the square.  This was my que, I grabbed my belongings and left town.  My journey would not be by sea, so I decided to walk, but had no direction other than to head back home.  Survival was the eminent thought on my mind.

### Leaving Azir, late Arodus

This journal is the last of the books I write and the beginning of my path to solve this haunted mystery.  On the outskirts of Azir, I buy what I need for my journey east and travel with a public caravan which seems to be the safe option.  While traveling we were attacked by bandits and the caravan split up, leaving me lost and alone.  This part of the journey was the worst, as I am not prepared to survive in the wild and had to rely on others most of my life.  Nevertheless I did run into a traveler named Marun who allowed me to tag along as long as I would feed and care for his camels.

### City of Manaket, early Rova

Upon arriving in the city, the people and municipalities were in a complete frenzy preparing the city for an oncoming sand storm.  They say each year it is getting worse and each storm brings the desert closer to them.  Keeping a low profile, Marun allows me to continue working for him, feeding and caring for his camels.  By this time I am no longer inclined to learn about the nature around me, but to start learning how to communicate, as this will be my best option for survival upon my adventure.  Marun starts to give me a stipend and I use it to hire a linguistics tutor, her name is Maticela.  She tells me that she has been hired by a merchant to translate for him on their way to Merab and following my heart I ask to come along, already my charm is starting to work in my favor.  Marun gives me a camel to carry my belongings and we leave by the end of the month.  While upon our way to Merab, I find that awful book hidden in my bags and now I want to reach home more than ever.

### Merab, late Lamashan

What an incredible city I have encountered, it’s filled with all sorts of clockwork style fixtures and science seems to be in vogue.  It is such a relief to find a place that blends religion and science, it’s the first place I feel safe from the oppression of law.  It has almost made me forget that tramp Maticela, as she only used me to make her lover jealous, I am such a gullible fool.  The first things I do in my free time is scour the library to learn about this city and take notes on the local lore, but while I am there I meet an odd man talking to himself in a language that I have not heard, but seem to know.  When I ask him a question, I realize that I am speaking in that same language.  He turns to me impressed and asks me to his lab.  During this time I am free to learn the craft of spells from him and it is my new passion.  As much as I would like to stay here, my dreams are starting to blend with my reality and I am reminded of my further quest I must take towards home, wherever that may lead.

### Lamasara, early Neth

Making my way to Lamasara, I need to stop and start making some money, so I meet with the local librarian and offer my translating and writing services in order to make enough money to survive.  Not only did I make money, but I made enough to be able to start drinking wine again, even got myself a bad habit of coffee.  While in town the librarian showed me to the books on spells and Arcana arts in which I have really found a passion for.  This new mystical realm has been making me think about all my teaching on logic and laws, even making me think hard about the religious upbringing.  Maybe this all ties into what keeps supernaturally happening around me? Onward I head towards my homeland.

### Eto, Early Kuthona

This seems to be the longest part of my journey.  The travelling is painfully boring, but helps me practice my spells until I reach Eto.  Here I instantly look for a group of adventurers who are looking to head out for some loot, as I want to try my hand at magic.  I may even get a chance to use my spear!  I find a group and we set out to find some gnoll thieves in the area.  We found them alright, but I was not prepared to fight, nor was I prepared to be backstabbed by my fellow adventurers.  Luckily I left my camel at home, but now I know how to judge people’s motives a little better.  This mishap sets me back and I am forced to help other adventurers for small sums of money until I can get back on my feet, but this does not allow me to study any more history, as I am working all the time.  Soon I hook up with an experienced group that needs someone who can heal and since I have been learning this, go along for the adventure.  I find it a perfect fit, and am awarded a portion of the loot, which is the most money I have ever made, in fact more than my whole life combined.  I use the money to buy some much needed equipment.  On one adventure more of my mystery is revealed.  Of all the times it has brought me infortunes, this time it is coming in handy.  I am able to channel energy and use it for healing purposes.

My groups of adventurers want to leave for Sothis, and I agree since eventually I should make my way there and admit the inevitable: I must sail to Qadira.  On the way while being ambushed, my channeling takes a different direction and my form starts to light up and although I am conscious, my healing properties seem to flow from my very essence.  Later I find out our assailants were what they call undead.  This is a good clue to help me understand what and how to use my powers.

### Sothis, late Abadius

It has been great to get back to a large city.  I say my goodbyes to my fellow adventurers and seek out a ship captain to take me to Qadira.  This seems easy enough, but as soon as its time to head aboard my knees lock and I am not able to get on the ship, my fears have overtaken me and I cannot.  Feeling defeated, I decide to do what I know best: learn from books.  At the library I start to find out more about other dimensions and how that encounter with life energy affects those around me.  Could it be that my religion has deceived me this whole time?  Maybe another dimension is where I will find my answers?

By this time I am not worried about being arrested for this book I keep carrying, since I am so far from Azir, but I decide to start reading it. What does this book have in store for me, other than working, learning, and brushing camel hair?

On my way through the Rose quarter looking for a new wine, I stumble upon a curious shop and step inside.  This place is full of things that are either dangerous or bad décor, but which I do not know.  That is when I met Retreyious, the younger.  I took immediate liking to him and he asked me to come back as often as I liked, most likely since I had lots of money to spend.  Many afternoons he would play Go with me in the shop and after coffee would start to talk about his life as a liar.  Yes, he was a professional liar for one of the regional diplomats.  As I started to learn about disguises, bluffing, and the like, it was always amazing to me why after all his adventures; he chose to run a trinket shop.

 Then one day when I can to visit, I realized that there was more to his life than just mere trinkets.  In the place of his shop for all these weeks was an upscale camel grooming parlor!  He had vanished or was never there or? Anyways my camel got a healthy grooming anyways.  But while I was paying the cashier looked me in the eyes and said “Katapesh”.  This kept me up all night until I decided it was time to make something for myself.

### Ipeq, sometime in Calistril

On my way to Katapesh, I needed to cross the Cook River, which led me to this dirty city.  Maybe I need to fight some thugs or heal some friends, either way I stopped with all my traditional book reading, especially about religion, but kind felt called to learn more on the planes, at least when I could find a book about it.  Being tired of walking, today I tried to ride a camel, which did not go so well.  Day one was me getting tossed from the camel, day two was me getting spit on, and day three, well, it involved fecal matter.  My plan is to look at it straight in the eye, all mean like, and keep staring at it until it listens.  If I have to, I will spit in its eye.  If that doesn’t do it, I will give it a knuckle sandwich.

### Katapesh, finally in Calistril

What am I doing here?  First thing first, find some wine, maybe get a job?  No luck getting a job so I take up with Narmiae, a one-eyed butcher.  Not a mercenary, a real butcher, like sausages and steaks.  He lets me help with deliveries in Katapesh.  This is how I met Rayhem.  It was fortunate for me that while I was making a delivery that I happened upon some books that caught my eye.  I knew I was being watched while I was absorbing every word of some book on the planes that was left out.  It was Rayhem and he, although surprised that a delivery man could read, that invited me to study with him.  For what seemed like months I listened to every word he said and admired all he had to offer.   How was I going to repay him for his taking me under his wing like a father is to a son.

Soon enough I would be given the challenge.  He never said it, never asked me, but I somehow felt it.  As one day a group of adventurers, more than common adventurers, came back to meet with Rayhem.  It seemed they had met before.  This was my chance to follow the lead Rayhem had set before me and to start really utilizing my knowledge and powers.  Would this help me discover all these mysterious occurrences?  What about my book?  What about my parents?  Right now I feel confident about following these adventurers on their quest.  This may be the most important step I have made thus far!

### Some days later…

It has been hard to keep up with my journal.  These times are not like before, the places we are going can only be found in stories.  The things we encounter are pushing the limits of my powers and the lack luster approach my comrades have with death and killing is starting to scare me.  I must keep control or learn to control the things around me.  Soon we are going to leave this plane.
