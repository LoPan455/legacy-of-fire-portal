![Salah](/salah.png)
As a young child Salah Al-Din, an orphan in the night stalls of katapesh, became enthralled by a strange group of men who performed amazing feats of grace and style with their particular form of whirling dance. Every day Salah would look forward to their performances and soon he began imitating them in the streets. As he gained in form and ability he was approached by one of these dancers and introduced to the Fraternal Order of Dervishes. This was a small group that found beauty and truth in imitating the whirling desert winds while also maintaining a philosophy of overall goodness while not subscribing to the rules of man not unlike their ancestral home, the desert.

As Salah grew he started taking more and more trips into the desert, at first as a rite of passage as a dervish, but he soon came to find the shifting sands and starry nights truly fascinating. But he was torn by his love of people, the stories they told and their reactions to the tales he spun. And soon he was splitting his time between finding adventure in the desert and haunting the parlors and bars of Katapesh gaining knowledge and experience from all of the city's varied denizens.
