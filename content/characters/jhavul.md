 An Efreeti (fire genie) Prince who was seeking to gain power and influence by waking Xotani the Firebleeder. His wishcraft modified army ruled the area around Pale mountain hundreds of years ago. Before he could wake Xotani, Nefeshti and her army attacked and destroyed his forces.  IN the climactic battle, Jhavhul and all his best warriors disappeared from the battle field along with the wizard Andrathi. In their place was a scroll, which was scooped up by the gnoll cleric Shirak.
